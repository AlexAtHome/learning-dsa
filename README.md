# a dumbass trying to learn DSA on his own (gone wild, not clickbait)

What I'm trying to do here is to follow [this course right here](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/algorithm) and implement those data structures and algorithms myself, using Go. Then I compare my results with the course and try to correct my resuts when needed. I figured this would be a cool way to learn a new language - trying to implement DSAs.
